Your call has been forwarded to an automated voicemail 
Hi momma
Guess what
The teachers at school today told me I'm exceptional
That I'm gonna reach unimaginable heights
That I'm gonna go places they've never seen before
But you know the first unfathomable place Imma go
Your house momma
My teachers keep telling me that a mother's love is like peace
Given even to the most unworthy of people
Fought for till the very end
They've been saying it's like nothing in this world
Their lessons say 
a mother's love is more beautiful 
than a fresh Lily swaying in the breeze 
Like autumn
Not too hot not too cold
The perfect weather to play for hours
But i live in
Twenty first century Florida
Where there is no other season than summer
Where peace is rationed
And flowers can only grow through the cracks
Because beautiful things are crushed by high rises and strip malls
But my teachers say that's how it used to be 
17 years and 9 months ago
When I lived off of you
When I ate
What you ate
When I breathed
Your every breath
When I heard
Your every word
They tell me for a year after
You could no longer hold me within you
You fed me
and held me too
Coaxed me calm
Whenever I cried
And then one day
You went out
For some milk
And never came back 
You see I never understood it
Cause how does it take 9 years to get something you already had?
Because normally Dads
leave to grab the milk
Then come crawling back
To milk their child's success as if they did jack
And last time I checked my father's right by my side
Teaching me my pleases and thank you
That you would never approve of
Cause you would never want to hear how thankful I am
and anyway girls made to spread their legs
Don't gotta mind their P's and Q's 
Cause they ain't destined for anything great
Except for those amazing highs and wonderful rides
Momma i think you're incredibly vigilant
Because how did you know
That the day I see you again
I'd be saying
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Like the carly rae that was always playing in your car
I guess it's your sick attempt at foreshadowing
cause you were always planning your disappearing act
In that sense I guess you're compassionate too
Warning your precious baby of what's to come
Even if she was too young
Too stupid
Too innocent
to understand what it all meant
You see momma I find you exceptional
Because you're breaking every stereotype
Cause growing up all the movies and books
Tell me that my daddy the one who's supposed 
To be leaving before I even know how to tie my sneakers
Against all odds
You said 
no thank you to the
Report cards
Late nights
Skinned knees
Temper tantrums
But most importantly you said 
no thank you to 
seeing your baby girl on top
So I guess I'm glad that you didn't pick up the damn phone
Because now I can sure as hell say
That when I reach the top
The only thing you'll be seeing of me
Is 
my door
And the only thing you'll be hearing from me
Is
Don't call me
