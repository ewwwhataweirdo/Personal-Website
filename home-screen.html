  <h1>WELCOME!</h1>
  <p>Hello fellow internet dwellers, my name is Megan and this is my online oasis! 
    Programmed entirely from my wee little brain with little to no planning and a 
    truck load of interests. This site is heavily inspired by 
    <a href="https://fairygore.neocities.org/">fairygore by Tehsin</a> because 
    I just think it's awesome! This is my first website so be nice cause it's the 
    laws of the digital land :)</p>
